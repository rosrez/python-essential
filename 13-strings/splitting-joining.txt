1. SPLITTING STRINGS -- split()

>>> s = 'This is a string of words'
>>> s.split()
['This', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'of', 'words']

As we can see, split() split the string on a whitespace and produced its result as a list.

By default, split() also folds mutliple whitespace:

>>> s = 'This   is  a string of   words'
>>> s.split()
['This', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'of', 'words']

so the result is identical to the previous example, even if the input string contained more whitespace.

We can use other tokens to split strings, but that will not fold the split tokens as it does whitespace.


>>> words = s.split()
>>> for w in words: print(w)
... 
This
is
a
string
of
words

2. JOINING STRINGS - join()

The join method operates on the delimiter that is used between strings being joined:

>>> s = 'This is a string of words'
>>> words = s.split()
>>> words
['This', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'of', 'words']

>>> new = ":".join(words)           <--- NOTE THAT WE CALL ":".join() where ":" is the delimiter in the resulting string
>>> new
'This:is:a:string:of:words'

", ".join(words)
'This, is, a, string, of, words'
