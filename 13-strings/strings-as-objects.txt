1. STRINGS ARE OBJECTS

Strings used to be objects in Python 2 but those were not first class objects, as in Python 3. This means that the interfaces have changed a lot between the two versions.

We can invoke methods on string objects, like this:

>>> s = 'This is a string'
>>> s
'This is a string'
>>> s.upper()
'THIS IS A STRING'

2. THE format() METHOD

This method is often called on a 'bare' string (i.e. on a string constant), like this:

>>> 'This is a string {}'.format(42)
'This is a string 42'

NOTE: Older version of Python used to achieve this in a different way:

>>> 'This is a string %s' % 42
'This is a string 42'

OR

>>> 'This is a string %d' % 42
'This is a string 42'

This way of formatting strings still works in Python 3, but is considered obsolescent and will be removed in future versions.
