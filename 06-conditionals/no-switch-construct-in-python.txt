1. THERE IS NO SWITCH CONSTRUCT IN PYTHON

Most of the time, we can perform the same task using a dictionary and select a value based on a key.

    choices = dict(
        one = 'first',
        two = 'second',
        three = 'third',
        four = 'fourth',
        five = 'fifth'
    )
    v = 'three'
    print(choices[v])

In order to mimic the default clause, we use the get() method of a dictionary object:

    v = 'seven'                         <--- NO SUCH KEY IN OUR DICTIONARIES, INDEXING WILL RESULT IN AN ERROR
    print(choices.get(v, 'other'))      <--- USE get() TO PREVENT THE ERROR
