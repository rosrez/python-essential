1. OPENING FILES

We use the open() function to open files. By default, open() opens files in read mode. That is, these two snippets are equivalent:

    f = open('lines.txt')

    AND

    f = open('lines.txt', 'r')

The possible modes are:

r   - Read mode
r+  - Read & write mode
w   - Write mode
a   - Append mode

We can combine the above mode modifiers with text/binary modifiers:

t   - text file
b   - binary file

For example, we can specify 'rt' or 'wb' as arguments to open().

2. ITERATING THROUGH FILES

We can iterate through the file using the file object returned by open:

    for line in f:
        print(line, end = '')

Or, we can use the readlines() method of the file object to achieve the same effect:

    for line in f.readlines():
        print(line, end = '')
