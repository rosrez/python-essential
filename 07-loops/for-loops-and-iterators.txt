1. A FOR-LOOP REQUORES AN ITERATOR TO STEP THROUGH

An iterator can be a function like range(), fh.readlines(), etc.

Also, every container type, including strings, is an iterator.

     # tuple
    t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    print("tuple")
    for i in t:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()

2. enumerate() i- PROVIDING INDEX TO A FOR-LOOP 

This prints the next item along with its index. We iterate through the lines of a file and through characters of a string.

def main():
    fh = open("lines.txt")
    # enumerate produces two elements: the index and the value
    for index, line in enumerate(fh.readlines()):
        print(index, line, end='')

    s = 'this is a string'
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        print(i, c)
